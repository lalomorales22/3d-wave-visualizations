## Features

- Real-time 3D particle wave animations
- Interactive mouse influence on particle behavior
- Multiple color presets (Cosmic, Rainbow, Ocean, Sunset, Matrix)
- Customizable particle shapes (Circle, Square, Star, Diamond)
- Adjustable parameters:
  - Wave frequency and amplitude
  - Animation speed
  - Wave complexity
  - Turbulence factor
  - Rotation speed
  - Mouse force influence

## Technologies Used

- React
- Three.js
- React Three Fiber
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:https://github.com/lalomorales22/3d-wave-visualizations.git

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

The visualization comes with an interactive control panel that allows you to:

- Select different color themes
- Change particle shapes
- Adjust wave parameters in real-time
- Interact with particles using mouse movement

## Controls

- **Wave Frequency**: Adjusts the frequency of the wave pattern
- **Wave Height**: Controls the amplitude of the waves
- **Animation Speed**: Changes the overall animation speed
- **Wave Complexity**: Morphs between simple and complex wave patterns
- **Chaos Factor**: Adds random movement to particles
- **Rotation Speed**: Controls the rotation speed of the entire system
- **Mouse Force**: Adjusts the strength of mouse interaction with particles
